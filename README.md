Title: Project Disclaimer

Description: This project was created as part of a Udemy course "Practice Java by Building Projects- by Tim Short", and it is not an original work of mine. I undertook this project to learn and follow along with the concepts taught in the course. The course materials served as a valuable guide in the development process, and I'm grateful for the knowledge gained from it.

Acknowledgment: I want to give credit to the instructor for providing an excellent learning resource and allowing me to gain hands-on experience through this project. If you're interested in the course, you can find it here: https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-java-by-building-projects/
